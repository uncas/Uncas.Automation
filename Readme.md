#### Intelligent assistant

What are the most important things?
* Working efficiently
* Keeping on track, staying focused
* Maintaining an overview of the "world situation"

Overview:
* Page that lists important things
* Next things to do from calendar (Google calendar)
* Next things to do from todo lists (Trello, Jira)
* New messages to reply to or register (email, slack, messenger, Aula, Facebook groups)
* My recurring things to practice or work on (Google Sheets)
* Proposed plan for the rest of the day (based on a. fixed appointments in calendar, b. recurring plan, c. todos, d. messages)

Todos regarding intelligent assistant:
* Research whether an intelligent scheduler/organizer already exists (that can combine fixed appointments with other tasks or recurring tasks).
* Research APIs to Trello, Aula, Messenger, Facebook groups
