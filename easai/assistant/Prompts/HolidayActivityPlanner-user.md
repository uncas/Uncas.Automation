For this year's summer holiday, for my family of two adults and two children aged 12 and 10,
we are going to Berlin in Germany.

Day 1:
We are going to drive from Kolding to Berlin.
At 15:00 we can check in at a hotel in Berlin, where we are going to stay 6 nights.

Day 7: At 11:00 we should check out from the hotel.
Then we will drive towards Kolding again.

The hotel has swimming pools (both indoor and outdoor) and play grounds.
Some days we would like to relax at the hotel.
Other days we would like to explore tourist attractions.
